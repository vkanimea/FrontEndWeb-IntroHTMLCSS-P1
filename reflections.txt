You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

* I have learned some interesting ways to write some magic in html and to summarize these below
    * headers from h1, h2, h3  size tags, remember h1 is largest
    * paragraphs p tag
    * bold letters b tag
    * italics i tag or emphasis em tag
    * inserting images img src="" tag
    * inserting hyperlink a href="" tag
    * inserting superscript using sup or sub tag
    * inserting lines using br tag
    * always remember that every good thing has a beginning and an end so use <> </>
    * keep your content in the body tag


* I found setting the layout easy using headers and paragraphs
* It was difficult to understand inserting images and hyperlinks until I had a few examples to complete.
* I keep asking myself what have I learn't, keep trying because the best is yet to come and the harder it may feel, the better it is once its' done.
